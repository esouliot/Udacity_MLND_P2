    "1.) Decision Tree: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The ID3 Decision Tree Classifier takes a training data set with attribute-classification pairings, and splits the data along the attribute that best separates the data into positive and negative classifications. For data sets with many attributes, the algorithm iterates this task until the positive and negative classifications are perfectly separated, or until there are no more attributes with which to split the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage to this algorithm is in its relatively low computational requirements per iteration (being linear relative to the number of attributes and number of instances). However, because the algorithm is set to continue splitting either until all the instances are classified, or until there are no more attributes with which to split the data, it is prone to overfitting on the training data at the expense of accuracy in the testing set. It is possible to avoid this type of \"over-splitting\" by setting a hard cut-off for the tree depth (how many levels of nodes the tree can split to), but this approach may also lead to poor testing accuracy if the data is noisy (that is, even the attributes with the best information gain still have a mix of positive and negative instances). \n",
    "\n",
    "So with the above in mind, the Decision Tree Classifier may be a good candidate for this task if the data has low noise, and there are attributes that \"cleanly\" split the positive and negative instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) Support Vector Classifier: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The Support Vector Classifier (SVC), also takes a set of attribute-classification pairings and separates the positive and negative instances. But unlike the Decision Tree Classifier, which splits attributes to separate positive and negative instances, the Support Vector Machine uses a kernel function - in this case, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) - to \"project\" a multi-dimensional attribute set into a space where the features can be linearly separated so that the margin (the space between the boundary and the closest positive and negative instances) can be maximized. \n",

    "\n",
    "The Radial Basis Function can also be tuned on two important parameters - the 'C' value, and the 'gamma' value. The 'C' parameter controls the trade-off between accurately classifying all instances, and the simplicity of the decision boundary. A higher C means a more complex boundary, which may capture small differences in the attributes of borderline cases, but may also overfit the training data in an attempt to correctly classify as many training instances as possible. The gamma value can be thought of, according to sklearn, as the inverse of the radius of influence of a given sample. A higher gamma value means that any given vector only has a minimal radius of influence as to how subsequent instances will be classified. And thus, with a big enough gamma, the entire training set would be used as the support vector in drawing the boundaries. This may prevent a model from over-generalizing a small dataset, but if a population has higher variance than the training sample, then the high-gamma RBF will not properly account for those instances not in the small circle of influence of our given data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the Radial Basis Function is tuneable on the C and gamma parameters, the SVC with an RBF kernel has high upside in that it can work with complicated data to draw \"clusters\" and point out groups of \"at-risk\" students with similar attribute values. But, because of the complexity involved in applying the RBF kernel to our many attributes, the SVC runs the risk of being very computationally expensive. It is likely to work well in our small training set of 300 samples, but it is unlikely to do so for larger datasets (i.e. state-wide data, region-wide data). \n",
    "\n",
    "3.) AdaBoost (Decision Tree Classifier): http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#adaboost\n",
    "\n",
    "The AdaBoost learner takes a \"weak\" learner (in this case, the Decision Tree Classifier), and re-trains it using an iterative weighting method. If the weak learner misclassifies an instance, the probability of that instance re-appearing is increased. If the instance is classified correctly, the probability of appearance is decreased, which allows the weak leaner to re-train on cases where it was wrong. At the end of the boosted training, the learner to be used for the testing set is the weighted \"vote\" (or sum) of all the weak learners. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is likely to give the boosted learner an advantage in prediction accuracy over the non-boosted learner because of its ability to self-correct. However, because AdaBoost is iterative in nature, we no longer have the advantage of small computational cost that the single decision tree had. But, because we still have a relatively small dataset (300 training points), if the boosted learner shows to have a significantly larger testing accuracy, it may be worth the higher computational cost. \n",
